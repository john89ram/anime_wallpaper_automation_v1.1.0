Version: 1.3.0  
Release Date: 2025-07-13

CHANGELOG:

🎨 Character Preservation & Prompt Refinement
- Step 2 prompt rewritten to preserve original outfits and identity of characters.
- Removed default “cyberpunk” scene injection and tech suit bias.
- Characters are now lightly enhanced to match style while staying canon-accurate.

📝 Final Prompt Logging
- Step 3 now logs each final prompt by character first name and date.
  ➤ Example: `output/logs/final_prompt_history/Naruto_07132025.txt`

📁 Output Directory Structure Overhaul
- All debug JSON and output assets now follow clean structure:
  - `output/json/` → GPT responses, clean JSON files
  - `output/logs/images/` → Final image generations
  - `output/logs/final_prompt_history/` → Individual prompt logs

🛠️ Styling Bias Fix
- GPT now avoids replacing traditional outfits with futuristic suits unless canon (e.g., DBZ).
- Output is now true to character source, style-enhanced only when visually helpful.

✅ Summary
- Final prompts now archive beautifully.
- Characters like Bojji, Yuno, and Vegeta are rendered faithfully.
- Automation is aligned with anime fan expectations and artistic integrity.
